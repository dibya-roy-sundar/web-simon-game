## Gameplay 🎮

Web Simon Game is a digital version of the classic Simon game, which challenges players to repeat a pattern of colored lights and sounds. The game features four colored buttons - 🔴 red, 🔵 blue, 🟢 green, and 🟡 yellow - that light up and play a sequence of tones in a random pattern. The player must then repeat the pattern by pressing the buttons in the same order. Each round adds one more step to the pattern, making the game increasingly challenging as it progresses.
